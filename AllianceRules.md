1. Be active daily. Preferably more than once a day so that you can adequately take out nodes in the war or quest. It's not a big time commitments. You have up to 5 energy in AW and AQ. So you can login maybe every 5-6 hours -- that's 3 times a day (cuz u need sleep too.)

2. Be communicative. Talk to us if you are busy. We understand that we all have lives and other things to attend to. Tell us why you had to take a break or take someone else's path in AQ or AW

3. Read the chat before moving in AQ or AW. That way you don't miss some of the ad-hoc strategizing and planning that we do 

4. Follow your assigned BG

5. Do not just take over someone's path for no reason. Unless you are helping them by giving energy and you are KOed or maybe you need a faster route to the boss becuase we are running out of time, or that the opponent is too OP so officers told you to skip -- then it's ok, otherwise please don't do it. 

6. Be strategic. If you are bad at takin on Thing or IMIW, then leave it for other people. Use your judgement and be considerate of other people's level when choosing a path. But also learn how to defeaut those champs since there's loads of good videos.

7. Read the linked nodes before proceeding.

8. Don't just join to reap the rewards other people earned. You gotta participate to earn it.
