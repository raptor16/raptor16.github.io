** Use your own judgement on whether or not you should join the way. For example, it's 2 hours before war ends and there's 3 more slots, then of course join. If there's 1 hour left then pls join any bg if there's a spot so I have time to place them.

** Side note for backup folks: When we are doing an AQ while AW should join BG3 map2 so you can reuse champs!

Do not forget to not blindly put champions, choose the high ranking defensive champions that you have. Linked here: https://www.mcoc-guide.com/alliance-war-defender-suggestion-defensive-tier-list/
